Tic-Tac-Toe Game API

Description
-----------
In this project the game Tic-Tac-Toe is implemented using Google AppEngine and Google DataStore.

The game consists of API endpoints (back-end) for the game. These endpoints will allow anyone to develop a front-end for Tic-Tac-Toe.

Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Many different Tic-tac-toe games can be played by many different Users at any given time. Each game can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter 'urlsafe_game_key'.

There are three possible scores - Win, Loss, Tie.

For a futher description of the game itself please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe


Installation
------------
1) Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered in the App Engine admin console.

2) Run the app with Google AppEngine Launcher, and ensure it's running by visiting the API Explorer - by default localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer

3) (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with the endpoints tool.

4) Deploy the application to Google Cloud.
